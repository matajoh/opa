The rego-cpp project is a Rego compiler and runtime implemented in cross-platform C++.  As such, it provides the ability to integrate Rego natively into a wider range of languages on most platforms. In addition to CMake FetchContent support for C and C++, we also distribute a Rust crate and a Python wheel. We support v0.68.0 of the rego language as well as full v1.0 compatibility.
